# SAST Evaluation and Implementation

This repository serves as the centralized platform for:

- Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools evaluation  
- SAST standardization and implementation  
- DevSecOps security workflows  
- Tool-level documentation  
- CI/CD security integration patterns  

## Structure

docs/report/        → Official submitted evaluation report  
implementation/     → Standardized SAST enforcement logic  
tools/              → Tool-specific documentation and commands  
workflows/          → CI/CD pipeline examples  
references/         → Security frameworks and standards  

## Purpose

This project bridges the gap between **security research** and **security implementation** by combining:
- academic-grade evaluation
- industry-grade tooling
- DevSecOps workflows
- infrastructure standardization

This is not a demo repository — it is a reference architecture for SAST adoption and enforcement.
