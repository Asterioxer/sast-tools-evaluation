# GitHub CodeQL

## Overview
A semantic code analysis engine developed by GitHub to query code as if it were data.

## Detection Approach
Treats code as a relational database. Vulnerabilities are found by writing queries against the database.

## Supported Languages
C/C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Ruby, Swift.

## Strengths
- Deep semantic understanding; free for open source; immense library of community queries
- Native integration with GitHub Advanced Security; runs via GitHub Actions

## Limitations
- Steep learning curve for QL; requires compilation for compiled languages; enterprise features cost money

## Ideal Use Case
Teams hosted on GitHub and security researchers looking for deep logic flaws.
