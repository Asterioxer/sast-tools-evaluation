Broadest language support in the industry (27+), including obscure legacy languages.

## Strengths
- Depth of analysis is unmatched; enterprise-grade reporting and compliance mapping
- Audit Workbench provides a rich interface for triage
- Robust CI/CD and IDE plugins

## Limitations
- Can be slow on large codebases; complex setup and maintenance; high cost

## Ideal Use Case
Government, Defense, and Banking sectors where depth of analysis is paramount.
