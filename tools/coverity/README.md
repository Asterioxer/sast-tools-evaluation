# Synopsys Coverity

## Overview
Renowned for its precision in identifying critical quality and security defects, particularly in C/C++.

## Detection Approach
Deep semantic analysis and interprocedural data flow analysis. Advanced configuration options for aggressive or conservative analysis modes.

## Supported Languages
Strong focus on C/C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby.

## Strengths
- Lowest false positive rate in the industry for C/C++; creates a complete build map for accuracy
- Integrates with build systems (Make, CMake, Maven, Gradle) and CI servers

## Limitations
- Initial configuration can be complex; primarily optimized for compiled languages

## Ideal Use Case
Embedded systems, automotive, and critical infrastructure software development.
