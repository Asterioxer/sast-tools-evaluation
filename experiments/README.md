# SAST Experiments

This directory contains controlled, hands-on experiments where selected SAST tools
are executed against intentionally vulnerable applications.

## Scope
- Validate detection capabilities
- Observe output formats
- Compare signal vs noise
- Evaluate usability and findings quality

## Non-Goals
- Performance benchmarking
- False-positive rate quantification
- Production readiness claims

## Important Note
All test applications in this directory are intentionally vulnerable and must never
be deployed or used in production environments.
