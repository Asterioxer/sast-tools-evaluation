    ❯❱ java.lang.security.audit.sqli.jdbc-sqli.jdbc-sqli
          Detected a formatted string in a SQL statement. This could lead to SQL injection if variables in the
          SQL statement are not properly sanitized. Use a prepared statements (java.sql.PreparedStatement)    
          instead. You can obtain a PreparedStatement using 'connection.prepareStatement'.

     ❱ javascript.express.security.audit.express-check-csurf-middleware-usage.express-check-csurf-middleware-usage
          A CSRF middleware was not detected in your express application. Ensure you are either using one such
          as `csurf` or `csrf` (see rule references) and/or you are properly doing CSRF validation in your    
          routes with a token or cookies.                                                                     
          Details: https://sg.run/BxzR

    ❯❱ javascript.express.security.injection.raw-html-format.raw-html-format
          User data flows into the host portion of this manually-constructed HTML. This can introduce a Cross-
          Site-Scripting (XSS) vulnerability if this comes from user-provided input. Consider using a         
          sanitization library such as DOMPurify to sanitize the HTML within.                                 
          Details: https://sg.run/5DO3

    ❯❱ javascript.express.security.audit.xss.direct-response-write.direct-response-write
          Detected directly writing to a Response object from user-defined input. This bypasses any HTML      
          escaping and may expose your application to a Cross-Site-scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Instead, use
          'resp.render()' to render safely escaped HTML.

   ❯❯❱ python.sqlalchemy.security.sqlalchemy-execute-raw-query.sqlalchemy-execute-raw-query
          Avoiding SQL string concatenation: untrusted input concatenated with raw SQL query can result in SQL
          Injection. In order to execute raw query safely, prepared statement should be used. SQLAlchemy      
          provides TextualSQL to easily used prepared statement with named parameters. For complex SQL        
          composition, use SQL Expression Language or Schema Definition Language. In most cases, SQLAlchemy   
          ORM will be a better option.
